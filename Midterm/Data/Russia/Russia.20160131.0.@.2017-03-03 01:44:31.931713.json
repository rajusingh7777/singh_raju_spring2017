He is survived by his beloved wife of 56 years, Magdalena; his son, Peter (Lisa), his granddaughter, Camille; and his brother, Jerzy Brzechffa. As a five year old in 1940, he was deported by Russia to the Steppes of Kazakhstan from Lwov, Poland, with his mother, Bronislawa, grandmother, and one year old brother. They remained there for six years. His father, Roger, had been one of the 14,000 Polish army officers shot and buried in the Katyn massacre in the same year. He returned to Poland after the war with his family. He graduated with a Master's degree in chemistry from the Gdansk Polytechnic Institute. He met and married Magdalena, also a chemist in 1958. In July 1967, he defected from Poland with his wife and son and successfully immigrated to America within four months. In December 1967, he found a permanent position as a research scientist at Sandoz Pharmaceuticals and retired in 1995. He was a very caring, loving husband, father and grandfather. He loved life, always smiled, was extremely positive and friendly to all he met. He was passionate about sailing, tennis, opera and traveling around the world with his lovely wife.
