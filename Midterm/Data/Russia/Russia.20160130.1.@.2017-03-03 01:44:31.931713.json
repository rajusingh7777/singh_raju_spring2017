He is survived by his beloved wife of 56 years, Magdalena; his son, Peter (Lisa), his granddaughter, Camille; and his brother, Jerzy Brzechffa. As a five year old in 1940, he was deported by Russia to the Steppes of Kazakhstan from Lwov, Poland, with his mother, Bronislawa, grandmother, and one year old brother. They remained there for six years. His father, Roger, had been one of the 14,000 Polish army officers shot and buried in the Katyn massacre in the same year. He returned to Poland after the war with his family. He graduated with a Master's degree in chemistry from the Gdansk Polytechnic Institute. He met and married Magdalena, also a chemist in 1958. In July 1967, he defected from Poland with his wife and son and successfully immigrated to America within four months. In December 1967, he found a permanent position as a research scientist at Sandoz Pharmaceuticals and retired in 1995. He was a very caring, loving husband, father and grandfather. He loved life, always smiled, was extremely positive and friendly to all he met. He was passionate about sailing, tennis, opera and traveling around the world with his lovely wife.

A classic \"New Yorker,\" in every sense of the word, Christina was a native of the Upper West Side for over 50 years. She was an avid Riverside Park gardener, a frequent face at Fairway, and knew every sidewalk crack and crevasse of the Upper West Side. The daughter of Vera Federoff, of Ryazan, Russia, and Bertrand J. Laney, of New York City, Christina was born in Hankow, China, on December 28, 1932, her family fleeing China in 1940, shortly after the Japanese offensive. A true explorer, Christina traveled the world with her family, attending schools in China, Panama, El Salvador, and finally, at the University of Texas, and at New York University. It was in 1953, that Christina, in her own words, \"found her Nirvana\"-New York City. For over 30 years, she was involved in the entertainment industry, acting in small movie and television roles, then working behind the scenes in public relations, advertising, and film production. At United Artists, Christina was the Assistant to the Director of Special Projects for six years. She also worked for the Writer's Guild. Christina was a Vice President of Women of the Motion Picture Industry, and won their Dottie Reeves Humanitarian Award for Community Service. Christina's hobbies were manifold. Her diminutive size and powerhouse personality made her a natural spelunker. She was a member of the National Speleological Society for many years. A talented artist and poet in her own right, Christina supported Women in Motion Pictures, and the Curtain Club. She championed dozens of causes including: The Humane Society, The New York Historical Society, Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society, World Wildlife Fund, The Nature Conservancy, and the ASPCA. Christina was a lifelong volunteer for groups such as Channel 13, The Girl Scout Council of Greater New York, and, for 50 years, the Riverside Park Conservancy, where she was honored for her volunteer contribution in her beloved garden on 78th Street and Riverside Drive. Before there was Google, there was Christina. A voracious reader and a fount of knowledge about a myriad of subjects, especially New York City, family and friends could always rely on Christina for an irrefutable answer. Into her 80s, Christina was a brilliant, plucky, feisty spitfire who continued to stimulate her mind by regular attendance at jazz concerts, museums, art galleries, and theater. She was a devoted sister, aunt, cousin, and friend-a tiny woman with a huge spirit, who will be deeply missed. Christina is survived by her older sister, Kera Toline Rogers of Charleston, SC; niece Catherine Anna Toline, husband Leo Lentsch; nephews, John Colin Toline, and son John, Mark Anderson Toline, wife Ann, and son North, and Paul Alexander Toline; and cousins, Barbara Laney Swenson of Hanover, New Hampshire, Ainslie Drummond of Florida, and Irene Morgan Kay of Australia. Christina's ashes will be interred in Moline, Illinois, with her parents and Russian grandmother, Barbara (Babi) Federoff. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in memory of Christina B. Laney to: Riverside Park Conservancy, 475 Riverside Drive, Suite 455, New York, NY 10115.<br><br>\n ","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  LANEY, CHRISTINA "},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2016-01-30T19:02:31Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"56addb2d38f0d81d27cb231f","word_count":"522","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/reuters\/2016\/01\/30\/world\/europe\/30reuters-mideast-crisis-syria-geneva.html","snippet":"A delegation from Syria's main opposition group arrived in Geneva on Saturday to join U.N.-mediated peace talks, demanding President Bashar al-Assad's government be made to comply with a U.N. resolution on humanitarian aid and human rights....","lead_paragraph":"A delegation from Syria's main opposition group arrived in Geneva on Saturday to join U.N.-mediated peace talks, demanding President Bashar al-Assad's government be made to comply with a U.N. resolution on humanitarian aid and human rights.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Stage Is Set for Syria Peace Talks as Opposition Arrives in Geneva","print_headline":"Stage Is Set for Syria Peace Talks as Opposition Arrives in Geneva"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2016-01-30T03:23:47Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"None","section_name":"World","subsection_name":"Europe","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By REUTERS","organization":"REUTERS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"56ac734138f0d87a41957651","word_count":"937","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2016\/01\/30\/world\/middleeast\/ap-syria.html","snippet":"The main Syrian opposition delegation vowed Saturday not to participate in U.N.-sponsored peace talks with the government unless their demands are met, including lifting the siege imposed on rebel-held areas and an end to Russian and Syrian bombar...","lead_paragraph":"The main Syrian opposition delegation vowed Saturday not to participate in U.N.-sponsored peace talks with the government unless their demands are met, including lifting the siege imposed on rebel-held areas and an end to Russian and Syrian bombardment of regions controlled by opposition fighters.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Syrian Opposition Vows Not to Participate if Demands Not Met","print_headline":"Syrian Opposition Vows Not to Participate if Demands Not Met"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2016-01-30T08:43:58Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"None","section_name":"World","subsection_name":"Middle East","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"56acbe8238f0d87a41957697","word_count":"800","slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
